# Zig search
Takes in a map (see maps/map.txt) and finds the shortest path to the goal.

The maps can be any shape or form, define a start with `s` and a goal with `g` walls are `#` and thats it.

### Note!
This project was meant for me to learn zig, it is not well writen nor is it optimized but it works.
